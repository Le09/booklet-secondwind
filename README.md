# Second Wind Booklet

This is a booklet for the Second Wind project,
where each song is a poem with an illustration.

This EP is a collaboration between George Alexander on the music, Flora Lin on the vocals, and Woolion on the lyrics and illustrations. 

The illustrations have been made as Chinese painting on rice paper, then scanned and glitched up in software.
