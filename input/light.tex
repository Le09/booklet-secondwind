\begin{minipage}{0.6\textwidth}
    \begin{verse}
    Light that shines \\
	Golden leaves \\
	Maybe I won't come back \\
	To a place so warm \\
	All my dreams \\
	Feel so real \\
	If only I had more time \\
	And I'd reach them all
    \end{verse}
    
    \begin{verse}
    Like honey \\
	The sun around me \\
	Is sweet and wrapped \\
	Around the room \\
	Oh slowly \\
	The room is shining \\
	Dust is turning to precious stones
    \end{verse}

    \begin{verse}
    (Chorus) \\
	Lost in time \\
	Capture all these moments \\
	Lavender scent \\
	Does it fill the tower I built \\
	In my head \\
	Sounds of joy bouncing on the walls
    \end{verse}

    \begin{verse}
    Blinding sun \\
	Red colors \\
	Turning to nightime blues \\
	Crystal skies \\
	Things that I have never seen \\
	My heart is always racing \\
	Should I be sad it's temporary \\
	And soon I won't \\
	Ever feel this way again
    \end{verse}
    
    \begin{verse}
    Black onyx \\
	The stars are shining \\
	We're flying high \\
	With man-made wings \\
	Eternal \\
	Like songs and paintings \\
	Is it a mad-man's quest to beauty?
    \end{verse}

    \begin{verse}
    (Chorus)
    \end{verse}
