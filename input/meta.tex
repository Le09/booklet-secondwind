Cover of the song by Calla Soiled, with original lyrics.


\begin{minipage}{0.5\textwidth}
    \begin{verse}
    The world is but a story memory \\
	Words building a morality \\
	Only a fiction \\
	Bloom flowers \\
	The transient world I observe \\
	Is all, but a moment that will go away \\
	The web of intangible lies \\
	Traps your life in its threads \\
	My heart is only \\
	A shapeless black shadow \\
	The web one spider makes \\
	Can lead you back from hell \\
	But crime and punishment are \\
	The same prison cell there is no escape
    \end{verse}

    \begin{verse}
    (Chorus) \\
	Metafiction is the only way \\
	I lost who I was in this deadend \\
	Semantics is the new syntax \\
	And everything became inverted \\
	I wonder what I am anymore \\
	I lost who I was when I entered \\
	My metafiction
    \end{verse}

\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}{0.5\textwidth}

    \begin{verse}
    Sun and steel \\
	True or false  \\
	Blood and thoughts \\
	Just void from my reality \\
	And odd nothingness \\
	Feelings are just static signals \\
	Through the void \\
	The moon reflection is still lingering \\
	Still full of mystery \\
	Still something I ignore \\
	Unknown humanity \\
	Nothing makes any sense \\
	Sapience found somewhere else \\
	But here it's all the same \\
	It haunts me hearing my soul yearning
    \end{verse}

    \begin{verse}
    (Chorus)
    \end{verse}

    \begin{verse}
    Metafiction is the only way \\
	I lost who I was in this deadend \\
	Semantics is the new syntax \\
	The vapor makes everything vanish \\
	I wonder what I am anymore \\
	I lost who I was when I entered \\
	My metafiction
    \end{verse}

\end{minipage}
