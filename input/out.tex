\poemtitle{Special Thanks}

If you are reading this, a very special thank you for your interest in our work.

Many thanks to \href{https://callasoiled.net/}{Calla Soiled} who agreed for us to cover his song \textit{META} with alternative lyrics.
Thanks also to Edwin who served as an excellent interpreter.
We are very grateful to \href{https://recreationalnoise.bandcamp.com/}{Recreational Noise} for his support and encouragement, and for his guitar on \textit{Rebirth}.

It is I, Woolion, who wanted to convey my feelings through music that I cannot write.
I penned lyrics, but it is only through the talent of George and Flora that they have come to life,
in a way that manifests their own vision and personal expression.
I am forever grateful to both of them for their hard work and dedication.
It brings me joy that we were able to create something beautiful together, and I hope this will resonate with your own heart.
