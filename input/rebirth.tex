\poemtitle{Rebirth}

    \begin{verse}
    I don't know what my thoughts are\\
    What My feelings are\\
    What words mean\\
    My link to the world is only a force of habit, a memory
    \end{verse}

    \begin{verse}
    Another turn of the wheel\\
    Transience\\
    Dissolving into nothingness\\
    Essence
\end{verse}

    \begin{verse}
    A shining ink, imperfection that completes the blank page\\
    As white as the snow of the highest mountain peak\\
    Dirty footsteps where no human had been
\end{verse}

    \begin{verse}
    Echoes from immemorial time\\
    The stones vibrate with their eternal music\\
    A poem with no limit, and no words
\end{verse}

    \begin{verse}
    On a path that is not a path\\
    With eyes that do not look at me
\end{verse}

    \begin{verse}
    Ride the tiger\\
    Roam and jump through the dark ages\\
    Let the dance of death crush people under its feet
\end{verse}

    \begin{verse}
    A rising beast tells me a secret\\
    But it's only a lie\\
    A philosopher speaks,\\
    but it's only confusion
\end{verse}

    \begin{verse}
    The ink flows,\\
    The cycle completes\\
    There is nothing to know
\end{verse}
