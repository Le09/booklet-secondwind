\poemtitle{Second Wind}

\begin{verse}
Don't know what my thoughts are \\
What do all these words mean \\
All I know is habit \\
One turn of the same wheel
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
Staring at a blank page \\
White like a high mountain \\
No one's ever been to \\
Who will be the first to reach?
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
Shining ink \\
Dissolving
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
(Chorus) \\
A poem that never ends \\
With words that never come \\
The beauty of nothingness \\
Completed by imperfections
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
Echoes from an old time \\
Stones trembling to the sound \\
Waiting for a secret \\
That can only be a lie
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
Jump through the dark age \\
There's only one way \\
Let dancers of death \\
Clear the confusion
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
Flowing ink \\
Complete cycle \\
There is nothing to know
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
A path that is not a path \\
Eyes looking at the void \\
Philosophers put some words \\
But they only bring more noise
\end{verse}
