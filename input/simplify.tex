\poemtitle{Simplify}

%\begin{minipage}{0.6\textwidth}
\begin{verse}
Here, all alone \\
In this room, so long \\
All this time in the dark till now
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
But the more you know \\
The more you doubt \\
So many truths only you can find \\
And no explanations can give you some peace of mind
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
(Chorus) \\
It's hard to simplify \\
Some things are better unknown \\
No one will simplify \\
What you must find on your own \\
It's hard to simplify
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
All the things I couldn't do \\
All the things they couldn't say \\
Only when they learned the truth \\
Soon they were all gone away
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
The less they know the more they shout \\
You wish you could stay in the dark
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
(Chorus)
\end{verse}
